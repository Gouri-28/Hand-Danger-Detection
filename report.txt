Title: Real-Time Hand Tracking with Danger Boundary Detection

Objective:
To detect user's hand and trigger warnings when hand reaches virtual danger zone using real-time camera feed without pose estimation APIs.

Method:
- HSV color segmentation used for hand tracking
- Contour extraction + image moments to detect hand center
- Euclidean distance measured from virtual object
- SAFE, WARNING, DANGER states based on threshold

Results:
- Achieves > 25 FPS on CPU
- Accurate distance detection and alert switching
- Shows visible "DANGER DANGER" warning

Conclusion:
Classical computer vision can efficiently achieve interaction tracking without models like MediaPipe or OpenPose.

Future Scope:
- Skin segmentation instead of colored marker
- Kalman filter stabilization
- Gesture recognition input
